Meeting Highlights
===
Much of what follows is a somewhat scattered list of notes about things that were dicussed during the meeting.  As we work toward solidifying what our overall goal is, and what the group will evolve to, this list will likely continue to grow.  We can (and should) organize it differently, but this is a first pass at capturing some of the ideas that were discussed.

 
Goals of the group
---
* Networking
* Build community
* Sharing knowledge
* Brainstorming & ideas for our own apps
* Book exchange

One item that was discussed at length, was to have a number of offshoot groups, and a way to get our kids, as well as others in the neighborhood, exposed to technology.  Doing so via coding projects, participating in an Hour of Code day, or even putting together a mini course for people to be able to build something, one bit at a time, while learning a passion for technology.

Meeting Format
---
We discussed a bit about how we want the format to look.  Ultimately our main goals for now are networking / community, and also to learn from each other.  We have a good representation of all levels of the stack in the group, which should offer solid chances for us to be able to teach eachother, and other members of the community.  To that end, the following is the rough format of future meetings.  

* 20 minute welcome / introduction to new comers / networking
* 30 minute presentation
* 10 minute discussion / planning finalization for next event

The presentation will be decided, for now, by vote in the Facebook group.  If that format doesn't work out, we can always put it up for a vote in the meetings, and update the meeting event with the topic for the month.

Action Items
---
* Look for chat software
    * Slack
    * Discord

I took the liberty of setting up a Slack Team. Slack url is coffeewithdevelopers.slack.com.  Send me a DM with your email address and I can send a sign up link.  Slack has the disadvantage of only allowing the last 10k messages be seen / searched with the free version.  Discord doesn't have that limitation, and may be a bit better for what we want overall.  I personally just have more experience with Slack and it took 5 minutes to setup.

Community Outreach next ups

Future Talk Ideas
---
* Tech Overview
* Hosting
* Linux
* Fluentd
* Programming Fundamentals
* Mobile Andriod Development
* Unknown, I just want to learn how to start

* Beginners Night


Decisions
===
Group Name
---
We can't have the official name of the group contain EastMark, so EastMark Developers is out.  We can have it in the Facebook page, but not the group name.  So, we decided to change the name to Coffee With Developers.  This is because coffee is awesome.  And we are developers.
